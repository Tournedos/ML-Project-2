> Each file is in the csv format and shows the x-y center of mass coordinates of one worm.
>
> Under "Lifespan" you will find "companyDrug" and "control" subfolders, which are from one experiment where a drug turned out not to have an effect on lifespan. However, can you find a difference in behavior in the presence of the drug? Note that the lifespan recordings were made for 6 hours at a time and the csv file thus restarts the frame numbering after each 10800 frames.

> More lifespan data to come.

> Under "Optogenetics" you will find the "ATR+" and "ATR-" subfolders. ATR+ means that the optogenetic systems in the worm neurons were functional. ATR- is the control. Here, the csv files have an additional column "Light_Pulse", which is 1 when the light was turned on. Can you find worm personalities, i.e., persistent differences between worms, including in response to the light stimulus? Here is a related reference
