>>Features
Each file is in the csv format and shows : 
1)frames 
2)-3) the x-y center of mass coordinates of one worm.



>>> Timing of the sampling
Key Takeaways from our Data 

Each frame corresponds to 2 seconds of elapsed time.
A session lasts 30 minutes = 900 frames = 1800 seconds
After each session, there is a gap of 5.5 hours, during which no data is recorded.

The Frame column resets to 1 after 10'800 frames.
This means Frame alone does not provide a continuous timeline for the wormâ€™s behavior.

So for a session + the gap it's 6 hours. So 900 frames correspond to 30min recording + 5.5 h of gap = 6 hours
In 10'800 frames we have 12 sessions of 900 frames. So before the frames resets it's 12 * 0.5h + 12 * 5.5h = 72h so 3 days


>> Handling NaN values :
I don't get it why it must be a bug with the microscope yes, but sometimes the values are just not given. for a few frames. But for a particular frame, if value of x is not given, it's neither for y and the speed thus equals 0 (must be in the skeleton code that if missing position --> set the speed to 0.

>> spliting worms

>>Step 3 : Standardization 
 Standardization ensures that all features are on the same scale, typically with a mean of 0 and a standard deviation of 1. This helps models converge faster and makes them less sensitive to the scale of input features. We have speed,X,>,changed pixels (and added categorie (0=companyDrug, 1=control))
 AVOID doing standardization on categorical or binary columns like Category

>> first objective
"Under "Lifespan" you will find "companyDrug" and "control" subfolders, which are from one experiment where a drug turned out not to have an effect on lifespan. However, can you find a difference in behavior in the presence of the drug? Note that the lifespan recordings were made for 6 hours at a time and the csv file thus restarts the frame numbering after each 10800 frames."

>> second objective : optogenetics
Under "Optogenetics" you will find the "ATR+" and "ATR-" subfolders. ATR+ means that the optogenetic systems in the worm neurons were functional. ATR- is the control. Here, the csv files have an additional column "Light_Pulse", which is 1 when the light was turned on. Can you find worm personalities, i.e., persistent differences between worms, including in response to the light stimulus? Here is a related reference
